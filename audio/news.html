  Tuticorin, also known as Thoothukudi, has recently experienced severe flooding due to heavy rainfall in Tamil Nadu. Heavy rainfall battered southern Tamil Nadu, on 18th  December 2023. The floods were so severe that they led to significant waterlogging in various areas with significant damage to life and property, and continued disruptions in daily life and operations. Although the specific information on the extent of life damage, such as loss of life or injury, has not been revealed to public. (Personal Source of Information) In addition, most ports of Tuticorin suffered a massive power shutdown due to the floods that affected daily activities, and families were not able to connect due to network failures.

  Economical Impact: <br>
  The Container Freight Stations (CFS) near Tuticorin port were heavily impacted. Goods worth crores of rupees stored in warehouses at these stations suffered extensive damage due to the floods. The warehouses, despite being located on higher ground and built sturdily, were inundated with nearly five feet of water, damaging many goods and completely ruining lakhs of cartons. This has caused great concern among garment exporters in Tiruppur, as most of the affected stock was meant for export.
